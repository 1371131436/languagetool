 -To use the simple demo GUI:
  java -jar LanguageToolGUI.jar

License:
 LGPL, see file COPYING
 
Known bugs:
 -OpenOffice.org integration:
   -Settings are not stored
   -LanguageTool gets confused when the text is changed while the LanguageTool 
    dialog is open
   -Checking of selected text sometimes throws java.lang.reflect.UndeclaredThrowableException
    at $Proxy17.gotoRange(Unknown Source)
   -some errors trigger two rules at the same position, this makes the "Change text"
    button work wrong
   -cursor first jumps to start of text, only then to the error position
   -there's no way to enable/disable rules if there's no error in the text
   
TODO:
 -translate rules that apply to English and German rules to German
 -make gui.Main use the Configuration class to save its settings
 -add information to rule about when it can give false alarm?
 -parse and use false friend rules
 -add more rules, especially agreement stuff
