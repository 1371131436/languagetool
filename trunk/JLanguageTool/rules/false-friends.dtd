False Friends DTD
Daniel Naber (http://www.danielnaber.de), 2001-12-21, 2005-08-20

This DTD defines a format for "false friends".

The DTD is designed in a way so that false friends can be
used in both ways, e.g. 'actual' is a false friend for
speakers of German, and 'aktuell' is a false friend for
speakers of English who write a text in German. The file
is not limited to English/German but can actually be 
extended to any number of languages, hopefully with minimal
redundancy.
