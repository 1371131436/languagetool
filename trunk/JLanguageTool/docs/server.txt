*** Server Documentation ***

This is an internal documentation for those members of the LanguageTool team
that have ssh access to our server. Please document paths and standard
procedures here, but (obviously) don't provide any passwords etc.

People responsible for the server:
  Daniel Naber
  Dominique Pell√©

The server is a virtual server from Host Europe, running at 176.28.12.50


=== www.languagetool.org ===

This is still hosted on the old server where only Daniel has
access. The plan is to move it soon. The website content gets
updated from SVN every 5 minutes via cronjob.


=== community.languagetool.org ===

This Grails-based website is hosted under ~/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/.

Update the data (Wikipedia examples) on community.lt.org for a given language:
  cd /home/languagetool/ltcommunity/corpus
  ./update.sh en
This will download a fraction of the latest Wikipedia XML dump, unzip it and run LT on it,
storing the rule matches in the database.

Update the data (Wikipedia examples) on community.lt.org for all languages:
  cd /home/languagetool/ltcommunity/corpus
  ./update-all.sh

Uptime check via Daniel's Account on www.livewatch.de.
