Internal documentation on how to make a LanguageTool release

-make a CVS update
-download latest translations from http://crowdin.net/download/project/languagetool.zip
 and put them into CVS
-set version number in build.properties
-set JLanguageTool.VERSION in JLanguageTool.java
-set the local IDE settings back to Java 1.5 and make sure that any compile problems
 are compile-time only issues, i.e. that the code will run under Java 1.5
 (e.g. using @Override is okay, using methods introduced in Java 1.6 is not)
-update CHANGES files
-update README file (e.g. list of supported languages)
-make sure there are no other local changes left that are not committed
-run "ant test"
-run "ant" 
-test command line application, OOo integration, and stand-alone GUI version
 with at least these test sentences:

    Je voudrais ajouter en plus quelque chose. (fr)
    Ovviamente... è tutto a gratis! (it)
    Dit is goed, en niet foutief. (nl)

-upload to the server:
    -dist/*.oxt, dist/README.txt and dist/CHANGES.txt to "download"
    -run "ant javadoc" and upload dist/docs/api/* to "development"
-run "ant jnlp" (note you need keystore.ks with the certificate to do this;
	for security reasons it is not in the repository. We need to ignore the
	"The signer certificate has expired" warning as no free certificates
	are available anymore, so the webstart user will get a warning)
-upload to the server:
    -dist/web/ to www/webstart/web/ (resulting from "ant jnlp")
-[still needed?] run "ant dist-tgz" and upload the file LanguageTool-X.Y.Z-dev-src.tar.gz
 (this is the source without libraries, needed e.g. for Debian packaging. For
 that, also make sure that the directory which contains the *.tar.gz is browsable)
-commit local version number changes to CVS
-tag release as V_x_y_z, e.g. V_0_9_2
 (Eclipse: 'Team -> Tag as Version' on the JLanguageTool project)

-update website
    -index.php (remember to also set $lastmod)
    -languages/index.php (run de.danielnaber.languagetool.dev.RuleOverview,
     remember to also set $lastmod)
    -languagetool.update.xml (active only if it's linked in description.xml)
    -...

-build.properties, JLanguageTool.VERSION in JLanguageTool.java:
    -set to next version: x.y.z-dev

-write announcements:
    -LanguageTool mailing list
    -http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/languagetool
    -freshmeat
    -http://twitter.com/languagetoolorg
    -Daniel's blog

Community update of the Wikipedia data on community.languagetool.org (needs server access):

 -unzip the current release in /home/languagetool/ltcommunity/corpus/code
 -if the CheckWikipediaDump.java itself has changed, upload the *.class files built by Eclipse 
 -in /home/languagetool/ltcommunity/corpus, call these for each language:
	./clean.sh de
 	./dowload.sh de
 	./check.sh de

Community update of the rules at community.languagetool.org (needs server access):

 -create a new JAR of the rules and resources of the current release:
 	zip -r LanguageTool-Rules.jar resource/ rules/
 -make a backup of /home/languagetool/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/LanguageTool-Rules.jar and LanguageTool.jar
  to a different directory
 -copy the newly created  LanguageTool-Rules.jar and LanguageTool.jar from the current release to
  /home/languagetool/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib
 -maybe update the other JARs, too
