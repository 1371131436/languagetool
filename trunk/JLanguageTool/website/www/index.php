<p class="firstpara"><strong>An Open Source language checker for English, German, Polish, Dutch, and other languages.</strong>
This is a rule-based language checker that will find errors for which a rule is defined in its 
XML configuration files. Rules for more complicated errors can be  written in Java. You can think 
of LanguageTool as a tool to detect errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect, e.g. mixing
up <em>there/their</em>, <em>no/now</em> etc. It can also detect some
grammar mistakes. It does not include spell checking. See the <?=show_link("languages", "languages/", 0) ?> 
page for a list of supported languages.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2009-01-21:</strong> Released version 0.9.6. Changes include:
<ul>
	<li>Better integration with OpenOffice.org (native checking dialog)</li>
	<li>Massive corrections to English, Polish, and Dutch rules</li>
	<li>New dictionary for Russian</li>
	<li>More features for rule developers, such as a better
	rule-based disambiguator and attribute unification</li>
	<li>Fixed a lot of bugs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update 2008-10-06:</strong> The LanguageTool maintainer team (Marcin Mi≈Çkowski
and Daniel Naber) just received
a <a href="http://development.openoffice.org/awardees-2008.html">Gold Award</a> in
the Sun Microsystems Community Innovation Program! The work honored with this award is
both the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> integration that is part of
LanguageTool 0.9.4 or later (download below) and the <a href="http://community.languagetool.org">Community
website</a> that lets you browse LanguageTool's error rules and vote whether an error
message is useful or not.</p>

<p><strong>Update June 2008:</strong> Please visit our new
<?=show_link("LanguageTool Community website", "http://community.languagetool.org", 0) ?>
 that lets you browse all rules for all languages. You can even create 
new (simple) rules if you're logged in.</p>

<p><strong>Installation and Usage:</strong>

<ul>
	<li><strong>In OpenOffice.org</strong>:
	Double click <tt>LanguageTool-0.9.6.oxt</tt> to install it.
	If that doesn't work, call <em>Tools -&gt; Extension Manager -&gt; Add...</em>
	to install it. Close OpenOffice.org and re-start it. Type some text
	with an error (e.g. "This is an test." -- make sure the text language is set
	to English) and you should see a blue underline (version 0.9.5 or later only).
	For version 0.9.2, you'll need to use the "LanguageTool" entries in the "Tools"
	menu to check a text.</li>

	<li>Also see <?=show_link("Usage", "usage/", 0)?> for using LanguageTool outside of OpenOffice.org.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If integration into OpenOffice.org doesn't work:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>LanguageTool installation fails if the name of your user account contains
	special characters. The only workaround so far seems to be to use a different
	user account. (Issue <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=95162">95162</a>)</li>
<li>Opening the spell checking dialog with grammar checking enabled and with a text
	language not supported by OpenOffice.org causes a crash/freeze (<a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=95996">Issue 95996</a>)</li>
<li>Did you restart OpenOffice.org - including the QuickStarter - after installation of LanguageTool? This is required,
	even if OpenOffice.org doesn't say so. (<a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=88692">Issue 88692</a>)</li>
<li>Make sure <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Java 5.0 or later from Sun Microsystems</a>
	is installed on your system. Java versions which are not from Sun Microsystems may not work.</li>
<li>Make sure this version of Java is selected in OpenOffice.org
	(under <em>Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Java</em>).</li>
<li>If LanguageTool doesn't start and you see no error message, please
	check if the extension is enabled in the Extension manager 
	(under <em>Tools -&gt; Extension Manager</em>).</li>
