JLanguageTool Change Log

0.8 (...)

 -Rules can now be enabled/disabled in GUI

 -the error displayed to the user is now taken from the "message"
  element, not from the "name" attribute anymore

 -implemented mark_from and mark_to attributes, these can
  be used to expand/shrink the area of text that is marked
  as wrong. Both attributes default to 0 so that the text
  marked as wrong is exactly the one that matches the pattern.

 -back references like \1 can now be used in error messages
  to refer to the parts of the original text that is matched
  by the pattern

 -a few German noun phrases like "der große Mann" are now checked
  for agreement. For example, "des großer Mannes" is detected
  as incorrect. This requires data in rules/de/categories which needs
  to be downloaded separately.
