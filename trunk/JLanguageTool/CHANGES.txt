LanguageTool Change Log

0.8.4 (2006-xx-yy)
 
 -Added new rules for English ("it's" vs "its" etc), German, and Polish
 
 -The false friend rules now offer a possible correction
 
 -reduced size of LanguageTool by using a more compact
  part-of-speech tagger
 
 -changed DTD to support more XML-like rule encoding
 
 -added lemmatization support, regular expression support
 
 -added AnalyzedTokenReadings class to support multiple readings 
  in all taggers, changed the code appropriately

 -some API changes
 
0.8.3 (2006-06-25)

 -Requires Java 1.5 now
 
 -Support for Polish (Marcin Milkowski)
 
 -Fixed a NullPointerException in DoublePunctuationRule
 
 -Added information to the README about how to compile LanguageTool for 
  .NET using IKVM
 
 -OpenOffice.org: The selection of the potentially incorrect text was wrong
  after paragraphs (on Windows only)
 
0.8.2 (2006-02-26)

 -New menu entry "Configuration..."
 
 -If you're a native speaker of German and write a text in English, LanguageTool
  can now warn you if you're using a "false friend", i.e. an English word that sounds
  like a German word but has a different meaning (e.g. become <-> bekommen).
  This also works vice versa (i.e. English native speakers will get a warning
  when writing a German text using a false friend).
 
 -Added a few new pattern rules
 
 -Missing whitespace after a comma is now detected

 -Added a new German rule that detects missing agreement in e.g.
  "meine Auto" (correct: "mein Auto"). This also introduces some new 
  false alarms.
 
 -Errors for German text are now displayed in German
 
 -Several other small fixes

 -Only relevant for developers: changes to rules.dtd (affect "lang" attribute)
 
 -Only relevant for developers: XML validation doesn't happen at runtime
  anymore but only when "ant test" is called
  
0.8.1 (2005-12-22)

 -Made it work for cases where the add-on installation path contains
  spaces (often seems to be the case under Windows)
 
 -Added a few rules for English

 -Added more exceptions so the English "a vs. an" rule works better
 
 -Other small fixes
 
0.8 (2005-12-17)

 -Added OpenOffice.org integration. Install the LanguageTool ZIP via 
  Tools -> Package Manager -> Add..., re-start OpenOffice.org and you'll 
  have an new menu item "LanguageTool" which checks your text.

 -The German data is now more compact (but still 40MB when uncompressed)
  and it's included in the standard distribution

 -Fixed morphology data for a few German words
 
 -Added some new simple pattern rules for English and German

 -Switched to new English part-of-speech data and new version of
  part-of-speech tagger (OpenNLP-tools 1.3)
  
 -Files are called LanguageTool instead of JLanguageTool again
  as the Java version is the only maintained version anyway

0.7.2 (2005-11-21)

 -several new pattern rules for typical German and English typos

 -new rule that checks for ".." and ",,"
 
 -new CaseRule for German text: complains if non-nouns are written
  in uppercase and checks uppercase spelling of "substantivierte Verben",
  e.g. "Das Laufen fällt mir leicht."

 -extension of pattern synatx: DT^foo|bar will match words tagged
  as "DT", except the word is "foo" or "bar"

 -fixed several false alarms (i.e. rules matching text which is
  actually correct)
 
 -fixed error marking for matches of pattern rules
 
 -fixed morphology data for these German words: Papagei, Virus, Stasi
 
0.7.1 (2005-09-08)

 -Rules can now be enabled/disabled in GUI

 -the error displayed to the user is now taken from the "message"
  element, not from the "name" attribute anymore

 -implemented mark_from and mark_to attributes, these can
  be used to expand/shrink the area of text that is marked
  as wrong. Both attributes default to 0 so that the text
  marked as wrong is exactly the one that matches the pattern.

 -back references like \1 can now be used in error messages
  to refer to the parts of the original text that is matched
  by the pattern

 -a few German noun phrases like "der große Mann" are now checked
  for agreement. For example, "des großer Mannes" is detected
  as incorrect. This requires data in rules/de/categories which needs
  to be downloaded separately.
  
 -a new rule checks whether a sentence starts with an uppercase letter
 
0.7 (2005-08-15)

 -first release of Java rewrite
