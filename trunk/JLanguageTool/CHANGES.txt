LanguageTool Change Log

0.8.5 (2006-xx-yy)

 -Fixed small bugs connected with special HTML characters used 
 internally and entities encoding
 
 -OpenOffice.org integration: documents > 64K can now be checked
  WARNING: There's still a problem with documents that contain tables,
  the wrong part of the text will be selected.

 -OpenOffice.org integration: progress dialog now really shows the progress

 -Introduced new POS tags for uncountable nouns (NN:U) and for nouns
  that can be used as uncountable (NN:UN). Added most common proper names
  to the English tagger dictionary.
  
 -LanguageTool can now run as a server that returns its results
  in a simple XML format via HTTP. Activate the server using
  "File -> Options..." or start it via command line using
  java -cp jaminid.jar:LanguageTool.jar de.danielnaber.languagetool.server.HTTPServer
 
 -By default, a single linebreak is not supposed to be a paragraph
  delimiter anymore (this was introduced in 0.8.4). With the command
  line application, you can use the new option -b to make LanguageTool
  take single linebreaks as paragraphs delimiters again. Two consecutive
  linebreaks are always considered a paragraph boundary (and thus a
  sentence boundary).
 
 -Added initial French, Spanish and Italian support
 
 -Added new rules for English and Polish
 
0.8.4 (2006-08-20)
 
 -Added several new rules for English, German, and Polish
 
 -The false friend rules now offer a possible correction

 -Stand-alone GUI: the program can now be docked to the system tray.
  Selecting any text and clicking on the icon in the system tray pops up
  the main window and checks the selected text. You need to unzip
  standalone-libs.zip for this feature to work (this was necessary so
  OpenOffice.org, which works on the same ZIP, doesn't get confused).

 -Stand-alone GUI: now stores its configuration to a file ".languagetool.cfg"
  in the user's home directory. Still buggy, as it only stores the configuration
  for one text language.
 
 -OpenOffice.org integration: cursor doesn't jump to start anymore before it
  selects the error

 -OpenOffice.org integration: LanguageTool's suggestions can now be accepted
  using a double click
  
 -A single line break in texts will now be interpreted as the end of a 
  paragraph thus also as the end of a sentence.
 
 -Reduced size of LanguageTool by using a more compact
  part-of-speech tagger
 
 -Changed DTD to support more XML-like rule encoding, added categories
 
 -Extended exception matching to multiple tokens, added more flexible ways 
  to match variable word order languages (via skipping tokens in rules)
 
 -Added lemmatization support, regular expression support
 
 -Added AnalyzedTokenReadings class to support multiple readings 
  in all taggers, changed the code appropriately

 -Some API changes
 
0.8.3 (2006-06-25)

 -Requires Java 1.5 now
 
 -Support for Polish (Marcin Milkowski)
 
 -Fixed a NullPointerException in DoublePunctuationRule
 
 -Added information to the README about how to compile LanguageTool for 
  .NET using IKVM
 
 -OpenOffice.org: The selection of the potentially incorrect text was wrong
  after paragraphs (on Windows only)
 
0.8.2 (2006-02-26)

 -New menu entry "Configuration..."
 
 -If you're a native speaker of German and write a text in English, LanguageTool
  can now warn you if you're using a "false friend", i.e. an English word that sounds
  like a German word but has a different meaning (e.g. become <-> bekommen).
  This also works vice versa (i.e. English native speakers will get a warning
  when writing a German text using a false friend).
 
 -Added a few new pattern rules
 
 -Missing whitespace after a comma is now detected

 -Added a new German rule that detects missing agreement in e.g.
  "meine Auto" (correct: "mein Auto"). This also introduces some new 
  false alarms.
 
 -Errors for German text are now displayed in German
 
 -Several other small fixes

 -Only relevant for developers: changes to rules.dtd (affect "lang" attribute)
 
 -Only relevant for developers: XML validation doesn't happen at runtime
  anymore but only when "ant test" is called
  
0.8.1 (2005-12-22)

 -Made it work for cases where the add-on installation path contains
  spaces (often seems to be the case under Windows)
 
 -Added a few rules for English

 -Added more exceptions so the English "a vs. an" rule works better
 
 -Other small fixes
 
0.8 (2005-12-17)

 -Added OpenOffice.org integration. Install the LanguageTool ZIP via 
  Tools -> Package Manager -> Add..., re-start OpenOffice.org and you'll 
  have an new menu item "LanguageTool" which checks your text.

 -The German data is now more compact (but still 40MB when uncompressed)
  and it's included in the standard distribution

 -Fixed morphology data for a few German words
 
 -Added some new simple pattern rules for English and German

 -Switched to new English part-of-speech data and new version of
  part-of-speech tagger (OpenNLP-tools 1.3)
  
 -Files are called LanguageTool instead of JLanguageTool again
  as the Java version is the only maintained version anyway

0.7.2 (2005-11-21)

 -several new pattern rules for typical German and English typos

 -new rule that checks for ".." and ",,"
 
 -new CaseRule for German text: complains if non-nouns are written
  in uppercase and checks uppercase spelling of "substantivierte Verben",
  e.g. "Das Laufen fällt mir leicht."

 -extension of pattern synatx: DT^foo|bar will match words tagged
  as "DT", except the word is "foo" or "bar"

 -fixed several false alarms (i.e. rules matching text which is
  actually correct)
 
 -fixed error marking for matches of pattern rules
 
 -fixed morphology data for these German words: Papagei, Virus, Stasi
 
0.7.1 (2005-09-08)

 -Rules can now be enabled/disabled in GUI

 -the error displayed to the user is now taken from the "message"
  element, not from the "name" attribute anymore

 -implemented mark_from and mark_to attributes, these can
  be used to expand/shrink the area of text that is marked
  as wrong. Both attributes default to 0 so that the text
  marked as wrong is exactly the one that matches the pattern.

 -back references like \1 can now be used in error messages
  to refer to the parts of the original text that is matched
  by the pattern

 -a few German noun phrases like "der große Mann" are now checked
  for agreement. For example, "des großer Mannes" is detected
  as incorrect. This requires data in rules/de/categories which needs
  to be downloaded separately.
  
 -a new rule checks whether a sentence starts with an uppercase letter
 
0.7 (2005-08-15)

 -first release of Java rewrite
