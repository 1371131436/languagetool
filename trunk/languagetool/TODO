-move all tests from "tests/*" to real test cases

German:
	-False alarms (i.e. sentences that are correct but that trigger an error message):
		-...
	-checks for upper/lowercase spelling would be nice (e.g. "Hin und Her")

English:
	-whitespace test fails to detect whitespace in fron of punctuation
	-make "testsuite.py all" run
	-"You will lost all changes." ->  this used to be "will[VM0] lost[VVD]",
		now it's "will[VM0] lost[AJ0]" -> error not found anymore
		(this is the missing error: <error from="73" to="77"><message>Modal verbs 
		like 'will'/'might'/... require base form of verb.</message></error>,
		see tests/entest7.txt)
		==> TaggerTest currently fails, is that related?!

Hungarian:
	-...
