#English multiwords file used for EnglishHybridDisambiguator
# Use this file only for multi-word terms that have these properties: 1) disambiguation is not necessary. 2) the term has only one part of speech (NOT sotto voce, which is RB and JJ).
# Do not add the term to spelling.txt, because spelling is ignored automatically for each term in this file.
# Terms are case-sensitive, but for each term, POS is added and spelling is ignored for (1) all uppercase text and (2) for text that has a capital letter for the first character of the first word.
